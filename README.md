# No Code Deep Leaning Visual Editor


Making Deep learning architectures can be difficult, writing the same boiler plate code from scratch can be more difficult than that. That's why we created a no-code deep learning tool, that lets you create deep learning architectures, with custom hyper parameters, and lets you downlaod the Pytorch file with the architecture you designed at the end.

### Features That Work

1.⁠ ⁠Creating architectures in Feed Forward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks
2.⁠ ⁠Getting the Pytorch file back after designing the architectures.


### More Features in the Future

1.⁠ ⁠Enabling to add more Architectures - Transformers, GANS, LSTMs.
2.⁠ ⁠Letting the User design the Data Transformations they want to Apply
3.⁠ ⁠Better UI - Drag and Dropping.
4.⁠ ⁠More Robust Design of Pytorch Files.
